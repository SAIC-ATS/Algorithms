Yamartino
- The Yamartino algorithm is used for calculating the standard deviation of compass values.  More information here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamartino_method
- The Processing example compares the results of the "standard" and Yamartino methods.
- The Arduino example is a template and requires the user to modify the code to get the latest heading value from their compass module.
- /Yamartino/Arduino/Yamartino contains an Arduino Library that can be used in other sketches.  Includes an example.
